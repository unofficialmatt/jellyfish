 NAVIGATION
 
 Jellyfish comes with a horizontal style primary navigation menu, which has a small amount of styling applied by default. The key features of the navigation menu are:
- responsive with customisable breakpoint
- single level or nested (out-of-the-box to one level, however  easy to extend)
- smooth animation on drop down
- collapse to burger menu on smaller screens 
- no duplication of HTML for smaller screens

&how it works well with Wordpress



Navigation breakpoint
Jellyfish's navigation can be customised to 'kick in' at a breakpoint of your choosing - ie. changing from a collapsed burger menu to a full width tabbed design.
To customise the breakpoint, you will need to adjust $nav-expands in the _settings.scss file (must be a px value) as well as variable navPoint in assets/js/scripts.js
