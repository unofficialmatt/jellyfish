  <p class="standfirst">Jellyfish is a lightweight SCSS and JS framework to add to the <a href="https://github.com/search?q=css+frameworks" rel="external">ever-growing list</a>.</p>
  <p>Jellyfish is mobile-first, flexible and scalable - providing browser-consistent styles for default HTML elements, along with some useful components and modifiers. Jellyfish uses <a href="./variables.html">SASS variables</a> throughout, with a handful of variables being converted and exposed as CSS custom properties to allow for in-browser modification.
    Jellyfish also <del>ships</del> swims with a small handful of helpful <a href="./javascript.html">Javascript functions and utilities</a>.</p>

  <h2 class="h3">Using Jellyfish in your project</h2>
  <p>Jellyfish is intended to be used as a dependency, via npm. The HTML/php <a href="https://github.com/unofficialmatt/Jellyfish-HTML5" target="_blank">starter repo</a> provides a good example of use.</p>
  <pre class="language-markup"><code class="code-ref">$ npm install jellyfish-ui</code></pre>
  <h3 class="h4">SASS 7-1 Pattern</h3>
  <p>Jellyfish is built with the <a href="https://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern" target="_blank">SASS 7-1 pattern</a> at it's core. In order to preserve this in your project's output CSS, you should import the SCSS files in the appropriate order:</p>
  <pre class="language-scss">
      <code>
        @charset "UTF-8";
        @import "jellyfish-ui/src/scss/jellyfish/01-tools/__all";
        @import "01-tools/__all";
        @import "02-settings/__all";
        @import "jellyfish-ui/src/scss/jellyfish/03-generic/__all";
        @import "03-generic/__all";
        @import "jellyfish-ui/src/scss/jellyfish/04-elements/__all";
        @import "04-elements/__all";
        @import "jellyfish-ui/src/scss/jellyfish/05-vendor/hamburgers/hamburgers";
        @import "05-vendor/__all";
        @import "jellyfish-ui/src/scss/jellyfish/06-objects/__all";
        @import "06-objects/__all";
        @import "jellyfish-ui/src/scss/jellyfish/07-components/__all";
        @import "07-components/__all";
        @import "jellyfish-ui/src/scss/jellyfish/08-utilities/__all";
        @import "08-utilities/__all";
      </code>
    </pre>
  <h3 class="h4">Javascript</h3>
  <p>You should also include the Javascript files - either by importing the src files into your build process or by including the dist file <span class="code-ref">/dist/js/jellyfish.min.js</span> in your project's markup.</p>
